    <h1>Dataset: Pedestrian tracking with group annotations</h1>
    <p>
		Here we provide multiple datasets containing the pedestrian position 
and group data. The tracking of pedestrians was done using automatic 
tracking systems, whereas the groups were labeled manually. The data was
 taken in two environments: "DIAMOR" and "ATC".
	</p>
	<p>
		The DIAMOR environment datasets were taken in two large straight corridors connecting the <i>Diamor</i>
 shopping centre in Osaka, Japan, with the railway station. The 
pedestrian tracking was done using multiple laser range finders, using 
the method described in reference [3].
	</p>
	<p>
		The ATC environment datasets were taken in part of the <i>ATC (Asia and Pacific Trade Center)</i>
 shopping and business center in Osaka, Japan. The tracking of 
pedestrians in this environment was done using 3-D range sensors. For 
more details see [4]. For additional data from this environment you can 
also check the <a href="http://www.irc.atr.jp/crest2010_HRI/ATC_dataset/">ATC dataset page</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		All annotations were done by a single coder (note: this is different 
from [1], where an agreement between two coders was used). Apart from 
group annotations, consisting of IDs of all pedestrians in the group, 
the socially interacting partners are also annotated (the definition of 
social interaction is given in [1]).

			<h2>Datasets</h2>

			<p>
				The dataset contains 8 experiment days, 2 in the DIAMOR environment 
and 6 in the ATC environment. For each day the data for 4 1-hour periods
 is provided: 10:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-16:00, 19:00-20:00.<br>
				The data is provided as zip compressed files, one file per 
experiment day. Each zip file contains one or more files containing the 
person tracking data (<i>person_[DATASET_NAME]_[TIME].csv</i>) and one containing the group annotations (<i>groups_[DATASET_NAME].dat</i>).
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Person tracking files</u> contain the data for <b>all</b> persons
 that were tracked in the environment on a given day and period of time.
 Each row corresponds to a single tracked person at a single instant, 
and it contains the following 8 fields (<i>comma separated values</i>):<br>
				TIME [s] (unixtime + milliseconds/1000), PEDESTRIAN_ID, POSITION_X 
[mm], POSITION_Y [mm], POSITION_Z (height) [mm], VELOCITY [mm/s], 
ANGLE_OF_MOTION (direction of velocity vector) [rad], FACING_ANGLE (body
 direction) [rad]
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						In the DIAMOR environment data the tracking was done with laser 
range finders, so there is no height infromation, i.e. POSITION_Z is 
always 0.
					</li>
					<li>
						The tracking systems in DIAMOR and ATC have different characteristics. See [1] and additional references for details.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				<u>Group files</u> contain the group annotations for the given day. 
Only pedestrians in groups are listed, pedestrians walking alone are not
 included. Each row corresponds to a single tracked pedestrian inside 
one group, and it contains the following fields  (<i>space separated values</i>):<br>
				PEDESTRIAN_ID&nbsp;&nbsp;GROUP_SIZE&nbsp;&nbsp;PARTNER_ID_1 ... 
(list of ids of all other pedestrians in 
group)&nbsp;&nbsp;NUMBER_OF_INTERACTING_PARTNERS&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERACTION_PARTNER_ID_1
 ... (list of all socially interacting partners)<br>
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						The PEDESTRIAN_ID can take the following special values:
						<ul>
						<li>
							-1 = pedestrian without ID (i.e. not tracked by the system)
						</li>
						<li>
							negative value = not a person, i.e. either a baby carriage/stroller, or a wheelchair. <br>In this case the PEDESTRIAN_ID can be followed by a negative number with the following meaning:<br>
							-2 = wheelchair,<br>
							-3 = automatic wheelchair,<br>
							no negative number (the number after PEDESTRIAN_ID is positive, i.e. GROUP_SIZE) = baby carriage/stroller.
						</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						When a pedestrian has multiple IDs (if the tracking was 
interrupted and then re-started), the first ID is followed by a zero in 
the second field, then by the total number of IDs belonging to that 
pedestrian, and the remaining IDs. After that the row continues with 
group size, etc., as written above.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pedestrians tracked twice in different groups are considered as 
different pedestrians (even if with the same ID) and they have no 
special notation.
					</li>
					<li>
						The number of fields in each line are different depending on the size of groups and the number of interacting partners.
					</li>
					<li>
						Even though the person tracking files for the ATC environment 
contain the data for pedestrians in the whole environment, the <u>group labeling was done only in a part of the corridor</u>
 (approximatelly in the westmost one third of the corridor, close to the
 central hall). Groups that did not move through this area were not 
labeled!
					</li>
				</ul>
